- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tonin386
- 👀 I’m interested in DeepLearning, Machine Learning and Data Science in general
- 🌱 I’m currently learning a lot of things :D
- ✍️ But I'm pretty familiar with Python, C++, C, PHP and Java!
- 🧠 I’ll be looking for a 6 month internship starting in September 2024! If you work with Data and need an intern... :)
